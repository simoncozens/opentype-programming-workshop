# Thinking In OpenType

## An introductory workshop to OpenType Programming

These are the student and teacher resources created for the
"Introduction to OpenType Programming" for the @typewknd conference
2020. I've since renamed it "Thinking In OpenType" to highlight the
fact that it focuses more about grasping the fundamentals of how
OpenType works and gaining the ability to apply those fundamentals to
one's own requirements, rather than talk about recipes and examples
for OpenType fonts.

This repository contains the "dummy" (without discretionary features)
Open Sans font used in the workshop, the [teacher's
manual](./manual.md), [student's workbook](./workbook.pdf) and
[Keynote slides](./OT%20Programming%20Workshop.key). Students attending
the workshop (or following along at home) will need a copy of the
[OTLFiddle application](https://github.com/simoncozens/otlfiddle/releases),
and preferably at least version 1.1.6 (which includes the necessary
Python modules).

This course will develop in response to feedback, so please feel free
to create issues or submit pull requests.
